TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
------------------------

Color Palette Summary:
- Sky: #B0E0E6, #87CEEB
- Grass: #228B22, #32CD32, #006400, #1F7A1F

- UI: #D3D3D3, #F0F0F0, #A0A0A0, #808080, #404040, #FFFFFF
- Centers: #FFD700

File Format:
- Source files provided as SVG with pixel-perfect rendering
- Recommended export format: PNG at 1:1 pixel ratio
- Maintain crisp edges and no anti-aliasing for authentic pixel art look

Canvas Implementation Notes:
- All sprites designed for integer pixel positioning
- Tiles are designed to seamlessly connect when placed adjacent
- Root components can be rotated and combined procedurally
- Stem tiles can be stacked vertically for variable height plants
- Color variations enable randomized garden appearances

Animation Considerations:
- Flowers can be swapped for bloom animations
- Stem tiles can be revealed progressively for growth animation
- Root components can be placed sequentially for root growth
- Seed sprite can transform into stem base
- All sprites maintain consistent pixel density for smooth animation

Scaling Recommendations:
- Base sprites work well at 1x, 2x, and 4x scaling
- Maintain pixel-perfect scaling (avoid fractional scaling)
- Consider implementing different sprite sets for significantly different zoom levels
- Test readability at target canvas resolution

Z-Layering Suggestions (back to front):
1. Sky background
2. Soil layer
3. Root system components
4. Grass layer
5. Plant stems
6. Flowers
7. UI elements

IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE
---------------------
To load and use sprites in HTML5 Canvas:

1. Load all sprite images
2. Create background by tiling sky, then soil, then grass
3. Place seeds at desired locations
4. Animate growth by:
   - Adding root components underground
   - Stacking stem tiles upward
   - Placing flower sprite at stem top
5. Position UI elements over scene

Each sprite is designed to work independently while maintaining visual cohesion as part of the complete garden scene.
